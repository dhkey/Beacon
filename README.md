# Beacon

Beacon is a fast, native application launcher for macOS. Open it from anywhere with a global keyboard shortcut, search installed apps and common destinations, then press Return to launch the selected result.

## Features

- Native SwiftUI and AppKit interface

- Search across system and user Applications folders
- Case-insensitive, diacritic-insensitive fuzzy matching
- Quick access to Applications
- Web search fallback in the default browser
- Keyboard navigation with the arrow keys and Return
- Configurable shortcut and manual application reindexing
- Menu-bar operation with no Dock icon

## Requirements

- macOS 26.0 or later
- Xcode 26 or later

## Build and run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dhkey/Beacon.git
   cd Beacon
   ```

2. Open `Beacon.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Select the **Beacon** scheme and run the project.

You can also build from the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Beacon.xcodeproj -scheme Beacon -configuration Debug build
```

## Releases

Every push and pull request to `master` is built and tested by GitHub Actions. Pushing a semantic version tag automatically creates a GitHub Release containing universal DMG, PKG, and ZIP packages.

### Create a release

1. Commit the changes that should be included in the release and push them to `master`:

   ```sh
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Prepare Beacon 1.0.1"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. Create an annotated tag on that commit and push it to GitHub:

   ```sh
   git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Beacon 1.0.1"
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

3. Follow the build in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/dhkey/Beacon/actions). When it succeeds, the new version appears on the [Releases page](https://github.com/dhkey/Beacon/releases).

Each release must use a new tag in the exact `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format, for example:

- `v1.0.2` for a bug-fix release
- `v1.1.0` for a feature release
- `v2.0.0` for a major release with breaking changes

The workflow uses the contents of the tagged commit, so push and tag the final release-ready commit.

## Install a release

1. Download the DMG from the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/dhkey/Beacon/releases/latest).
2. Open the DMG and drag **Beacon** into the **Applications** folder.
3. In Applications, Control-click **Beacon**, choose **Open**, and confirm the macOS security prompt.

The PKG provides a guided installer, while the ZIP contains the standalone application. The packages are ad-hoc signed because the project does not use a paid Apple Developer account, so the first-launch security confirmation is unavoidable. Developer ID signing and notarization can be added later without changing the release process.

## Usage

1. Press `⌥ Space` to show or hide Beacon.
2. Type an application or command name.
3. Use `↑` and `↓` to move through results.
4. Press `Return` to open the selected result, or `Esc` to dismiss Beacon.

Open **Beacon Settings** from the launcher or menu-bar item to record a different global shortcut or rebuild the application index.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup, testing instructions, and pull request guidelines.

## Tests

Run the unit and UI test targets with:

```sh
xcodebuild test -project Beacon.xcodeproj -scheme Beacon -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

## Project structure

Beacon indexes application metadata locally. A web-search result opens Google in your default browser only when you choose it.
