# AGENTS.md

This file contains repository-specific guidance for coding agents working on Beacon.

## Project overview

Beacon is a native macOS application launcher written in Swift with SwiftUI and AppKit. It runs as a menu-bar accessory, presents a floating launcher panel, indexes local applications, registers a global keyboard shortcut, and opens the selected application or destination.

The project intentionally has no third-party dependencies.

## Requirements

- macOS 26.0 or later
- Xcode 26 or later
- Use the `Beacon` scheme in `Beacon.xcodeproj`

## Important files

- `Beacon/BeaconApp.swift`: application lifecycle, menu-bar entry, and service wiring
- `Beacon/ContentView.swift`: launcher interface and keyboard interaction
- `Beacon/LauncherModel.swift`: indexing, search, selection, commands, and launching
- `Beacon/LauncherPanelController.swift`: floating AppKit panel behavior
- `Beacon/KeyboardShortcut.swift`: shortcut representation and global registration
- `Beacon/SettingsView.swift`: shortcut settings and manual reindexing
- `BeaconTests/BeaconTests.swift`: unit tests using Swift Testing
- `BeaconUITests/`: UI test target
- `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`: CI builds and tagged releases

## Working rules

- Read the relevant implementation and tests before changing behavior.
- Keep changes focused and preserve unrelated user modifications in the worktree.
- Follow the style of the surrounding Swift code; do not add a new architecture, package, or dependency unless the task requires it.
- Keep UI-bound mutable state and AppKit interactions on `@MainActor`.
- Keep slow filesystem discovery away from the main actor.
- Preserve keyboard-first behavior: arrow-key navigation, Return to launch, Escape to dismiss, and the configurable global shortcut.
- Preserve accessibility labels and identifiers when changing interactive UI.
- Add or update tests for search normalization, ranking, selection, persistence, and other testable behavior changes.
- Do not edit or commit `xcuserdata`, DerivedData, build products, or generated release packages.
- Do not change signing, entitlements, the deployment target, bundle identifiers, or release behavior unless explicitly requested.
- Do not create or push tags or publish a GitHub Release unless explicitly requested.

## Build and test

Run the unit tests used by CI:

```sh
xcodebuild test \
  -project Beacon.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Beacon \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -derivedDataPath test-build \
  -only-testing:BeaconTests \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

Run all configured tests when a change affects user-interface behavior:

```sh
xcodebuild test \
  -project Beacon.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Beacon \
  -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

For UI changes, also launch the app and manually verify the affected flow when the environment permits it.

## Before handing off

- Review `git diff` and ensure only intended files changed.
- Run `git diff --check`.
- Run the most relevant tests, or clearly state why they could not be run.
- Summarize the behavior changed and the verification performed.
